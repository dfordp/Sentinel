It also duplicates the existing “likes” functionality in the sense that both represent a user’s interest in another profile, but bookmarking is meant to be a persistent, personal list rather than a mutual match indicator.\n\nBecause the contribution was closed as spam and contains no implementation details, it does not provide actionable or new technical content for the repository.",

The problem is likely caused by a cache invalidation flaw in the system that stores user profile data in Redis. Since the profile data is cached for quick retrieval, failing to clear or update the cache after a profile edit means the UI continues to display stale information and the database update may not be reflected immediately. The bug directly affects a core feature—editing and saving user profiles—which is essential for users to showcase their skills and intent on the platform. Fixing this would require ensuring that the API endpoint performing the update clears or refreshes the relevant Redis keys and that the frontend reads updated data from the server or from a refreshed cache.",
        "difference_analysis": "Unlike general caching or matching bugs, this issue targets the persistence layer for user profile edits, a distinct requirement from match logic or swipe handling. It overlaps with the Redis caching strategy used elsewhere, but uniquely involves the profile update API and the cache key format for user profiles. The issue lacks reproduction steps, code snippets, and version context, making it less complete than other well-documented bugs.",
        "best_in_group": "false",

        "summary": "The PR implements UI consistency by ensuring that tapping the heart or reject buttons triggers the same left/right swipe animation that occurs when a user physically swipes a card. It reuses the existing swipe animation logic, applies it to button events, and adds logic to revert the card if the network action fails. This change improves user experience across devices by making the interaction feel unified, while also handling error conditions gracefully. The implementation touches the front‑end layer of the project, reusing core animation utilities and avoiding duplicate code.",

While other PRs may introduce new features like filtering or profile details, this one focuses on refining the core swipe interaction.

The changes reset the filter state whenever a user changes a filter, add immediate UI feedback by updating the handler, and remove problematic font imports that caused TypeScript errors. Dependency arrays in `useEffect` hooks were also cleaned up to avoid stale closures. These updates restore correct filtering behavior and improve developer ergonomics by preventing type errors during build.",

It overlaps minimally with other PRs that target UI behavior but offers unique value by resolving a specific stale closure issue that broke the filter UI.

It also fixes project handling for users with no existing projects, adds contact information to the Redis cache for faster access, and improves error handling with stricter TypeScript types. The changes directly improve user experience, data consistency, and performance, which are high-priority items for the project.",
