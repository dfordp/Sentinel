üîç Sentinel ‚Äî Get Signal, Kill Noise
A lightweight GitHub App that gives open source maintainers actionable community intelligence on:

Which PRs truly solve issues

Which ones are duplicate or spam

Whether new PRs add value or just noise

What‚Äôs worth rewarding‚Äîand what‚Äôs worth skipping

‚ö°Ô∏è Why?
In fast-paced open source projects, maintainers face a flood of PRs:
‚úÖ Some deliver solutions.
‚ö†Ô∏è Some are disconnected or misleading.
‚ùå Some are ‚Äúvibe spam‚Äù or low-effort, targeting bounty programs.

PR Sentinel isn‚Äôt just another code reviewer. It answers:

‚ÄúDoes this PR solve a real issue for our project and community, or is it just noise?‚Äù

Skip the manual hunt through ancient issues and avoid burning time triaging irrelevant submissions.

üóÇÔ∏è What It Does
‚úÖ Auto-classifies PRs

Detects if a PR is properly linked to open/valid issues

Flags PRs that are missing links or context, or seem unrelated

Spots contributor spam and repetitive, trivial edits

‚úÖ Summarizes PR & Issue Context

Shows relationships, cross-links: ‚ÄúThis PR closes #123, overlaps with PR #122‚Äù

Highlights stale/duplicate issues

Spotlights contributors with repetitive activity

‚úÖ Community Signal & Relevance Score

0‚Äì100% match: Does the PR really address the issue description?

Lightweight NLP scoring and comparison across related PRs

Insightful comments and status checks for maintainers

‚úÖ Action Suggestions

Merge candidate ‚Äî high match, all checks passing

Potential duplicate ‚Äî overlaps with existing open PRs

Likely spam ‚Äî trivial/unrelated, flagged for review or auto-close

Needs clarifying ‚Äî auto-comment to request clearer links or description

‚úÖ Contributor Reputation & Health Analytics (unique differentiator)

Track contributor trust scores using merge history, review feedback, and flagged/spam activity

Visualize new vs. returning contributors, high-impact teammates, and ‚Äúburnout risk‚Äù signals

‚úÖ Project Knowledge Graph & Governance Tools (unique differentiator)

Create a semantic map to search the evolution of features, linked discussions, and contributor impact

Track CLAs, compliance, onboarding documentation effectiveness

üèÜ Benefits
üîπ For maintainers
Decide faster: see which PRs are worth reviewing, which are likely spam, and spot outliers or duplicates immediately.
Triage better, reward what matters.

üîπ For contributors
Transparent feedback: see if PRs lack context or may be considered off-topic.
Skip unnecessary back-and-forth for basic checks.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
GitHub App ‚Äî organization-wide installation, secure and scoped

Works on PR creation/updates, listens to org events via webhooks

Pulls and processes related issues, PRs, contributor metadata

Uses fast NLP, clustering, and graph-based techniques for scoring/recommendation

Posts results as comments, status checks, and dashboard entries

Maintainers override or tune as needed

‚ú® Example
text
‚úÖ PR Sentinel report for #42

- Linked issue: #35 (Open)
- Relevance Score: 92% (Strong match)
- Overlaps: PR #40 (Same file edits)
- Community health: Author trust 4.8/5, no flagged spam in past 6 PRs
- Suggestion: Review for merge, coordinate with PR #40 to resolve conflict.
üì£ Built For
Busy maintainers handling high PR volume

Teams running bug bounties who need to filter out low-effort submissions

Projects that want community growth but need to keep quality high

Setup
Here are direct Docker run commands for each required service, as well as the corresponding environment variable configuration for integrating them into your backend‚Äîfor running alongside a Sentinel-style project like your outlined PR Sentinel tool.

***

### Docker Run Commands

#### PostgreSQL
```bash
docker run -d --name my_postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -p 5432:5432 -v my_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:latest
```

#### ZooKeeper (for Kafka)
```bash
docker run -d --name my_zookeeper -e ALLOW_ANONYMOUS_LOGIN=yes -p 2181:2181 -v my_zookeeper_data:/bitnami/zookeeper bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

#### Kafka (Bitnami, after ZooKeeper is running)
```bash
docker run -d --name my_kafka --network bridge -e KAFKA_BROKER_ID=1 -e KAFKA_CFG_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=my_zookeeper:2181 -e ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_LISTENER=yes -e KAFKA_CFG_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://:9092 -e KAFKA_CFG_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092 -p 9092:9092 -v my_kafka_data:/bitnami/kafka bitnami/kafka:latest
```

#### RabbitMQ (Management UI enabled)
```bash
docker run -d --name my_rabbit -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=guest -e RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=guest -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 -v my_rabbit_data:/var/lib/rabbitmq rabbitmq:management
```

***

### Backend Environment Variables

- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`
- `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres`
- `KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092`
- `KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER=localhost:2181`
- `RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/`
- `RABBITMQ_MANAGEMENT_URL=http://localhost:15672/`

***

### Usage Notes

- Each Docker command can be run in the terminal to launch a corresponding service for Sentinel or any similar backend.[1][2][3]
- Use the provided environment variables in your backend `.env` file or deployment config for seamless service integration and direct access.
- All services will have persistent data via Docker volumes and are accessible through the specified ports on localhost, supporting reliable operation of features like PR classification, context summary, relevance scoring, and contributor analytics.

This setup ensures that Sentinel‚Äîand related backend services‚Äîcan leverage PostgreSQL, Kafka, and RabbitMQ for robust processing, analytics, and community intelligence workflows.[2][3][1]
